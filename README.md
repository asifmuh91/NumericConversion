# NumericConversion
Numerical Conversion Project has services that can convert a sole valid number into words or valid integer exist in a sentence.
This application can be run from Main.java file. it has 2 options. 1 is to manually enter your input and 2nd is to enter your inputs via a file. Please follow instructions on console how to do so
Design: I tried to make it more service based so more services can be added in future of this project.For example if users have another requirement of converting numbers into integers, we can easily spin another service. Enums are used as we have constants units of tens.
Please run tests file to see expected output results.
